# Important features

add definition list for all the terms used into the electraoacoustics file.
such as V_in, V_spk, R_sys, R_nom, etc.

continue manual




# Bugs
no errors when the load file has invalid parameters like R_serial (R_serial is no more in use)
drag and drop makes double beep



# Nice to have
when motor definition type changes to Bl and Mmx, paste values from model into the widgets

add sine sweep time signal of displacements

make sine sweep example:
P = 48000
Q = 44100

offset = 2000
instfreq = np.exp(np.linspace(np.log(offset+100), np.log(offset+23900), 96000))-offset
deltaphase = 2*np.pi*instfreq/P
cphase = np.cumsum(deltaphase)
sig = np.sin(cphase)



add:
- Peak displacement at 1020Hz: 0.0143 mm
- Peak displacement overall: 0.313 mm
